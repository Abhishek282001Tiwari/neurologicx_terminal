**Title**: A Modular Neurosymbolic Framework for General-Purpose Reasoning: Bridging Symbolic and Deep Learning for Interpretable AI

**Author**: Abhishek Pankaj Tiwari

**Publication**: TechRxiv Preprint

**DOI**: [10.36227/techrxiv.175295182.20276969/v1](https://www.techrxiv.org/users/942678/articles/1316379)

### Abstract

> We present NeuroLogicX, a modular neurosymbolic framework that achieves state-of-the-art performance on bAbI reasoning tasks (94.2% accuracy) while maintaining full explainability. Our approach seamlessly integrates BERT-based neural perception with symbolic reasoning engines, demonstrating significant improvements over both pure neural (87.3%) and symbolic (91.1%) baselines. The framework provides complete reasoning traces, confidence calibration, and robust performance across task difficulties.
